# Project Description

## Theme 🏨
In this project, I have developed a microservices-based system for managing hotel reservations. The system comprises three core microservices: `hotel-service`, `room-service`, and `customer-service`. Each of these microservices plays a crucial role in managing various aspects of hotel operations.

## Microservices and Components 🧩

### Hotel Service 🏢
The `hotel-service` microservice is responsible for handling the management of hotels. I implemented functionality such as creating and updating hotel information, managing room availability, and providing essential data for customers' inquiries.

### Room Service 🛌
The `room-service` microservice specializes in room-related operations. I created this microservice to allow the addition and modification of room details, as well as maintaining room availability status for bookings.

### Customer Service 🧑
The `customer-service` microservice deals with customer data. I developed this microservice to facilitate customer registration, login, and profile management, making it a crucial component for the booking process.

### Gateway 🌐
To orchestrate and manage interactions between these microservices, I implemented an API Gateway 🌐. This gateway acts as a single entry point for clients and handles requests efficiently by routing them to the respective microservices.

## Extensions 🚀
I also implemented several extensions to enhance the functionality of my microservices-based hotel reservation system:

- **Booking Service 📅**: I created a new microservice that enables customers to book rooms, view booking history, and manage their reservations.
- **Payment Integration 💳**: I integrated a payment gateway to allow customers to make secure payments for their bookings.
- **User Authentication 🔐**: I enhanced user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure data security and user privacy.
- **Logging and Monitoring 📊**: I implemented comprehensive logging and monitoring to track system performance and detect issues proactively.
