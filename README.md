## Theme üè®

In this project, I have developed a microservices-based system for managing hotel reservations. The system comprises three core microservices: `hotel-service`, `room-service`, and `customer-service`. Each of these microservices plays a crucial role in managing various aspects of hotel operations.

## Microservices and Components üß©

### Hotel Service üè¢

The `hotel-service` microservice serves as the central repository for hotel-related information, including hotel locations, facilities, and room availability. It maintains data such as:

- Hotel locations and descriptions.
- Available room types and their amenities.
- Room availability and booking status.
- Customer reviews and ratings.

### Room Service üõå

The `room-service` microservice is responsible for managing room-specific data, allowing fine-grained control over room types, pricing, and availability. It handles:

- Room types, including descriptions and features.
- Pricing and availability of individual rooms.
- Special room offers and discounts.
- Maintenance and cleaning schedules.

### Customer Service üßë

The `customer-service` microservice is the primary interaction point for customers. It facilitates customer registration and profile management, ensuring seamless user experiences. It includes features such as:

- Customer registration and login.
- User profile management, including personal details and preferences.
- Booking history and reservation management.
- Secure payment processing and billing history.

### Gateway üåê

To orchestrate and manage interactions between these microservices, I implemented an API Gateway üåê. This gateway acts as a single entry point for clients and handles requests efficiently by routing them to the respective microservices.
